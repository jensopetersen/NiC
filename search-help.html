    <h1>Search Help</h1>
    <p>A number of search options are available for this database application. Simple searches are
        possible, but it is also possible to perform quite advanced searches. Search is based on the
        open source search engine <a href="http://lucene.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache
            Lucene</a> and tries to bring into play all the options that Lucene provides. </p>
    <section>
        <h3>Search Options</h3>
        <p>The search interface offers a number of choices.</p>
        <p>You can choose <em>which texts</em> to search in by selecting the checkboxes to the left of the titles. Note
            that if you do not make any choice, you will search in all available texts – there is no
            need to click all check boxes in order to perform a general search.</p>
        <p>You have a choice among <em>search modes</em>. These will be explained in more detail
            below, but the most common ones are "Any Search Term" and "All Search Terms". The first
            option is default, so if you do not make any choice, you will automatically search for
            any search term. What this means is that you want a hit no matter if one or the other of
            the words you input as search terms is present, or if both are, whereas if you search
            for all search terms, you only want hit if all of the words you input are present.</p>
        <p>Search is performed in a number of <em>fields</em> - to be more exact, in indexes based
            on certain fields. This contrasts with searches in a word processing document which are
            made in a document as a whole, as one long string of characters.</p>
        <p>You have the option to perform your search in different <em>works types</em> – instead of
            selecting works individually, you can select groups such as tragedies or poems. Here you
            can choose several different options.</p>
        <p>This may seem obvious, but you search for <em>words</em> - spaces and punctuation and so
            on cannot be searched for, but only the words themselves. All your input is stripped of punctuation and lower-cased, so you can just
            as well spare yourself the effort to input them.</p>
        <p>One may ask: if spaces cannot be searched for, what are phrase searches? Don't phrases
            consist of words with spaces and punctuation in between? Yes, but when you search for a
            phrase, this is not the same as when you search for a phrase in a word processing
            document – with Lucene, you actually search for a sequence of words which have no words
            in between them, so everything is about words after all (and a phrase search is actually
            a proximity search – more about that later).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Search Strategies</h3>
        <p>There are searches – and then there are searches.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One can search by simply filling in words in the query field, choose one of the
                search mode options ("Any Search Term" …) and press return (or click the magnifying
                glass). </li>
            <li>One can use the "standard" Lucene search options. These consists of marking which
                words you would like to occur in the hit-list and which word must (or must not)
                occur, of stringing together words with AND, OR and NOT, grouping words with
                parentheses, and so on. Quite complicated searches can be made with these
                options.</li>
            <li>One can use regular expressions. These offer options for wildcarding characters and
                so on. Regular expression searches can be used on top of Lucene searches.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These three different search strategies will be presented below, after a brief mention
            about the way hits are displayed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Hitlist and Search Relevance</h3>
        <p>When searching for books in a library catalogue, one can usually choose to have the hits
            displayed according to relevance or according to author, title or suchlike. In the
            Shakespeare app, hits are only displayed according to relevance, according to a "score"
            computed for each search. This is quite a complicated thing in itself, but basically,
            the more times your search terms occur in your search scope and the less common they are
            in the index the higher the score they will get and
            the more prominent they will be. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Simple Search</h3>
        <p>If you select "Any Search Term" and fill in some words in the query field, you are saying
            that you would like to see as many of the words in the search scope, but if there is
            only one of them present, you also want to have it displayed as a hit.</p>
        <p>If you select "All Search Terms" and fill in some words in the query field, you are
            saying that you want to see all of the words in the hits within the search scope – if
            just one of the words is missing, you do not want to have it displayed as a hit.</p>
        <p>If you select "Phrase Search" and fill in some words in the query field, you are saying
            that you want to see all of the words in the hits within the search scope, but only if
            they occur in the same sequence. This is the way searches are performed in word
            processing documents, except that here punctuation is disregarded.</p>
        <p>If you select one of the two "Proximity Search" option and fill in some words in the
            query field, you are saying that you want to see all of the words in the hits within the
            search scope, in the order specified or not, and within a certain proximity. The
            proximity is stated in terms of maximum number of words <!-- plus one?!? -->allowed in
            between the words your enter in your query. For instance, "probability character 6" will return the records in which those two strings appear within 6 words from one another. If you do not enter any
            digit, 5 will be assumed.</p>
        <p>"Fuzzy Search" needs a little explanation. If you take a word, like "probability", you can make
            changes and additions to it. One change would thus give you "spake", "slave", "snare"
            and "probabilitys". If you make one more change based on this, you can easily see that a lot
            of words can be generated. Since this search is very time-consuming, the maximum number
            of "edits" you can make is 2. If you do not enter any digit, 2 is also assumed. Fuzzy
            search demands so many resources that only one term can be searched at a time<!-- ? -->,
            so all words after the first will be removed from your query.</p>
        <p>"Wildcard Search" offers the possibility to search using ? for a single character and *
            for zero, one or more characters. You would retrieve hits with "shake", "spake", "stake"
            and so on with "s?ake", and "probability" and "probabilitys" with "probability*". "*ling" will give you
            "telling", "trembling", "brawling" and so on, "te??ing" will give you "telling",
            "teeming", "tending" and so on. This offers some of the functionality of a regular
            expression search, but be aware that the symbols ? and * have different meanings in
            wildcard and regex search.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Standard Lucene Syntax</h3>
        <p>With Lucene standard syntax, there are two ways you can go: you can either prefix words
            with + and - or use boolean logic with AND, OR and NOT (written in upper-case). In both
            cases, you can additionally group your search expressions using parentheses. In case you
            use any of these operators (or any operators used in regex searches), the search mode
            will automatically be set to Any Search Term (or to Regex Search if this applies), so
            choosing any of the other options has no effect.</p>
        <p>The first option (using + and -) is better suited to a search which orders hits according
            to score. Here you let words stand as they are (without + or -) if you would like them
            to occur in hits, but you prefix them with + if they must occur in a hit and - if they
            must not occur as a hit. If you search for "probability character" you get a lot of hits with
            either "probability" or "character" and some with both. If you search for "probability +character", all
            your hits will contain "character", but they may or may not contain "probability". If you search
            for "probability -character", you would like to see hits with "probability", but only if they do not
            contain "character".</p>
        <p>If you use AND, OR and NOT, the logic is rather different. If you search for "probability AND
            character" you get hits with both "probability" and "character" and none with only one of them. This
            corresponds to "+probability +character". If you search for "probability OR character", this is the same as
            simply searching for "probability character". If you search for "probability NOT character", this equals
            searching for "probability -character".</p>
        <p>If you use AND, OR and NOT, the logic is rather different. If you search for "probability AND
            character" you get hits with both "probability" and "character" and none with only one of them. This
            corresponds to "+probability +character". If you search for "probability OR character", this is the same as
            simply searching for "probability character". If you search for "probability NOT character", this equals
            searching for "probability -character".</p>
        <p>Searches can acquire higher complexity use of parentheses. Here the use of AND, OR and
            NOT may come more naturally. Say you want to find passages where the word character occurs
            but where also at least one of the words "probability", "cause", or "reason" occurs.
            You can express this by "(probability OR cause OR reason) AND character". An AND
            enforces "must occur" on both sides, so both one of the animals and the word "character"
            have to occur in the hits. Say (for some reason) you do not wish the words "trial" and
            "elevate" to occur in your hits – you then embroider your search expression with "NOT
            (trial OR elevate)" as "(probability OR cause OR reason) AND character NOT (trial OR
            elevate)"</p>
        <p>If you simply search for "trial OR cause AND character", you will (because the AND rubs off
            to the left), search for passages where "cause" and "character" must occur, but you would
            also like "trial" to be marked as a hit. You can enforce a certain logic on your query
            by grouping with parentheses.</p>
        <p>If you search for "(probability OR cause) AND character" you are saying that one or both of "probability"
            and "cause" must occur, as must "character".</p>
        <p>If you search for "probability OR (cause AND character)", you would like to retrieve hits where
            "probability" occurs and you would like to retrieve hits where "cause" and "character" go
            together. In practice this means that you will get a lot of "probability"-only hits.</p>
        <p>You can also nest parentheses, e.g. "(probability OR (cause AND character)) NOT trial" will
            remove the hits with "trial" from "probability OR (cause AND character". </p>
        <p>As you can see, the options are many …. And as if this was not enough, there is also
            regex – and regex syntax combined with standard syntax!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
        <p>Regular Expressions are also known as "regex" or "regexp". They are a very powerful tool
            for searching text (and for replacing text, but this is not relevant in a search
            engine). Lucene only supports a smaller range of regex operators, but they should,
            however, be enough for most uses.</p> If you use any of the regex operators (<code>. ? +
            * | { } [ ] ( ) " \ # @ &amp; &lt; &gt; ~</code>), the search will automatically switch to
        regex mode. Note that some of the operators are the same as those used in standard Lucene
        syntax, but they occur in different positions in relation to the words/character strings
        they operate on. <section>
            <h4>Match any character</h4>
            <p>The period <code>"."</code> can be used to represent any character.</p>
            <p> In order to retrieve the string <code>"probability"</code>, the following expressions can
                be used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>s.ake</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>.nak.</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>One-or-more</h4>
            <p>The plus sign <code>"+"</code> can be used to repeat the preceding shortest pattern
                once or more times. </p>
            <p>In order to retrieve the string <code>"cause"</code>, the following expression can be
                used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>de+r</code>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <section>
                <h4>Zero-or-more</h4>
                <p>The asterisk <code>"*"</code> can be used to match the preceding shortest pattern
                    zero-or-more times.</p>
                <p>In order to retrieve the strings <code>"weed"</code> and <code>"wed"</code>, the
                    following expression can be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>we*d</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note that in Lucene standard syntax, <code>"+"</code> and <code>"*"</code> serve
                    as wildcards, standing in for characters; here they quantify the immediately
                    preceding character (or pattern). </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Zero-or-one</h4>
                <p>The question mark <code>"?"</code> makes the preceding shortest pattern optional.
                    It matches zero or one times. </p>
                <p>In order to retrieve the strings <code>"weed"</code> and <code>"wed"</code>, the
                    following expression can be used:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>wee?d</code>

            <section>
                <h4>Min-to-max</h4>
                <p>Curly brackets <code>"{}"</code> can be used to specify a minimum and
                    (optionally) a maximum number of times the preceding shortest pattern can
                    repeat. The allowed forms are:</p>

                <h4> Character classes </h4>
                <p>Character classes are very important, since they allow you to mask variation with
                    more control than that offered by wildcards. You can thus use them to find words
                    even though they are written differently, e.g. have either "e" or "o" in a
                    certain position or have "a" and "e" in a certain position </p>
                <p>Ranges of potential characters may be represented as character classes by
                    enclosing them in square brackets <code>"[]"</code>. A leading <code>^</code>
                    negates the character class, that is, all characters other than the ones
                    following are signified.</p>
                <p> The allowed forms are:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>[abc]</td>
