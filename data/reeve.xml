                        <p> What Goddess, or what Muse must I invoke to guide me through these vast, unexplored regions of fancy?—regions inhabited by wisdom and folly,—by wit and stupidity,—by religion and profaneness,—by morality and licentiousness.—How shall I separate and distinguish the various and opposite qualities of these strange concomitants?—point out some as the objects of admiration and respect, and others of abhorrence and contempt? </p>

                        <p> In this fairy land are many Castles of various Architecture.—Some are built in the air, and have no foundation at all,— others are composed of such heavy materials,
that their own weight sinks them into the earth, where they lie buried under their own ru-
ins, and leave not a trace behind,—a third sort are built upon areal and solid foundation,
and and remain impregnable against all the attacks of Criticism, and perhaps even of time itself.</p>

many of my acquaintance, and I shall challenge them whenever I do.</p>

                                <p> I hope that you will assist my labours.—I will drop the metaphor, and tell you that I mean to take notice only of the most eminent works of this kind:—to pass over others slightly and leave the worst in the depths of Oblivion.</p>
                                <p>The word Novel in all languages signifies something new. It was first used to distinguish these works from Romance, though they have lately been confounded together and are frequently mistaken for each other.</p>
                                <sp>
                                    <sp>

                                        </speaker>
                                        <p> But how will you draw the line of distinction, so as to separate them effectually, and prevent future mistakes? </p>
                                    </sp>
                                    <sp>

                                        <p> I will attempt this distinction, and I presume if it is properly done it will be fol-
lowed,—If not, you are but where you were before. The Romance is an heroic fable,
which treats of fabulous persons and things.—The Novel is a picture of real life and
manners, and of the times in which it is written. The Romance in lofty and elevated language, describes what never happened nor is likely to happen.—The Novel gives a familiar relation of such things, as pass every day before our eyes, such as may happen to our friend, or to ourselves; and the perfection of it, is to represent every scene, in so easy and natural a manner, and to make them appear so probable, as to deceive us into a persuasion (at least while we are reading) that all is real, until we are affected by the joys or distresses, of the persons in the story, as if they were our own.</p>

                                        <p>You have well distinguished, and it is necessary to make this distinction.—I clearly perceive the difference between the Romance and Novel, and am surprized they
should be confounded together. </p>

have taken up an opinion upon trust in others whose judgment they prefer to their own.— Others having seen a few of the worst or dullest among them, have judged of all the rest by them;—just as some men affect to despise our sex, because they have only conversed with the worst part of it. </p>

Sticks, </i> (as the <i>Diable Boitu </i> is absurdly translated,) of the Bachelor of Salamanca, and of <i>Gil Blas,</i> which is a Novel of first rate merit.</p>

their Buffoonery.—Are you acquainted with his writings ?</p>

the vivacity of a wit, and the ease of a fine gentleman; they are somewhat exceptionable on the score of morals, and yet as little as can be expected from the Memoirs of a licentious court, that of Charles the Second, and the life of a man of pleasure like the Count <i>de Grammont.</i> I do not reckon this among the Novels, because it has truth for its foundation, though indeed highly embellished.—Of his Novels I know nothing, tho' I have made a strict enquiry after them, and I conjecture that they never were popular.</p>

It carries marks of imitation of <i>Boccace's Decameron, </i> and some of the stories are too far out of the limits of probability. Let us next consider some of the early Novels of our own country.</p>
                                                <p>We had early translations of the best Novels of all other Countries, but for a long
time produced very few of our own. One of the earliest I know of is the <i>Cyprian Academy,</i> by Robert Baron in the reign of <i>Charles</i> the First.—Among our early Novel-writers we must reckon Mrs.<i> Behn.</i>—There are strong marks of Genius in all this lady's works, but unhappily, there are some parts of them, very improper to be read by, or recommended to virtuous minds, and especially to youth.—She wrote in an age, and to a court of licentious manners, and perhaps we ought to ascribe to these causes the loose turn of her stories.—Let us do justice to her merits, and cast the veil of compassion over her faults.—She died in the year 1689, and lies buried in the cloisters
of Westminster Abbey.—The inscription will shew how high she stood in estimation at
that time.</p>

I forbear the name, and further observations on it, as Mrs. <i>Manley's </i> works are sinking gradually into oblivion. I am sorry to fay they were once in fashion, which obliges me to mention them, otherwise I had rather be spared the pain of disgracing an Author of my own sex.</p>

                                                        <p>Mr. Pope was severe in his castigations, but let us be just to merit of every kind. Mrs. <i>Heywood</i> had the singular good fortune to recover a lost reputation, and the yet greater honour to atone for her errors.— She devoted the remainder of her life and labours to the service of virtue. Mrs. <i>Heywood</i> was one of the most voluminous female writers that ever England produced, none of her latter works are destitute of merit, though they do not rise to the highest pitch of excellence.—<i>Betsey Thoughtless</i> is reckoned her best Novel; but those works by which she is most likely to be known to posterity, are the <i>Female Spectator,</i> and the <i>Invisible Spy.</i>—this lady died so lately as the year 1758.</p>

<i>Oliver Cromwell,</i> is one of the old <i>Novels,</i> if I may be allowed the expression, I do not
certainly know the Author, nor yet the date of the first edition.—When a Novel came
out but seldom, it was eagerly received and generally read, this was at the time called a work of uncommon merit, but it will not bear a comparison with those that have been written since. There is originality and regularity in it. The incidents are too much of the
marvellous kind, but some .of the scenes are very pathetic, and there is business enough to keep the reader's attention constantly awake, and above all other merit, it has a moral tendency.</p>

as <i>Crusoe's,</i> and that he stole his materials from thence, and then returned the manuscript to the Author—When <i>Selkirk's</i> book was published, it was taken but little notice of; it had more truth, but less Romance, and beside, the curiosity of the public was gratified, and they looked on <i>Crusoe</i> as the Original, and <i>Selkirk</i> as the copy only.</p>

                                                        <p>Robinson Crusoe was published in the year 1720.—<i>Gaudentio di Lucca</i> in 1725. I shall speak of these two books together, because there is a strong resemblance between them, the same marks of Originality appear in both.—They both give account of unknown or rather of Ideal countries, but in so natural and probable a manner, that they carry the reader with them wherever they please, in the midst of the most extraordinary occurrences. <i>Gaudentio di Lucca</i> is written by the pen of a master, it is imputed to Bishop <i>Berkely,</i> and is not unworthy of that truly venerable man.—There is a greatness of design, and a depth of penetration into the causes of the health and prosperity of a state, and of the moral evils that first weaken and undermine, and finally cause the ruin of it.—The vast consequence of the good or bad education of youth, on which depends the health, vigour, and happiness of a nation.—These circumstances gives this book a manifest superiority to the other, in many other respects they are both equally entitled to our plaudit.—But what gives a still higher value to these two books, they are evidently written to promote the cause of religion and virtue, and may safely be put into the hands of youth.—Such books cannot be too strongly recommended, as under the disguise of fiction, warm the heart with the love of virtue, and by that means, excite the reader to the practice of it.</p>

                                                        <p> A warm plaudit you have given them,—I remember to have read Robinson Crusoe when very young, but I have forgot it, and ever since I have looked upon it as a book for children only; but I will read it again upon your recommendation, and judge of its merits.</p>
