            <p>IF to&#160;Divert&#160;and&#160;Entertain, and at the same time to&#160;Instruct, and&#160;Improve&#160;the Minds
               of the&#160;Youth&#160;of&#160;both Sexes:</p>
            <p>IF to inculcate&#160;Religion&#160;and&#160;Morality&#160;in so easy and agreeable a manner, as shall
               render them equally&#160;delightful&#160;and&#160;profitable&#160;to the&#160;younger Class&#160;of Readers, as
               well as worthy of the Attention of Persons of&#160;maturer&#160;Years and Understandings:</p>
            <p>IF to set forth in the most exemplary Lights, the&#160;Parental, the&#160;Filial, and
               the&#160;Social&#160;Duties,&#160;and that from&#160;low&#160;to&#160;high&#160;Life:</p>
            <p> IF to paint&#160;Vice&#160;in its proper Colours, to make it&#160;deservedly Odious; and to
               set&#160;Virtue&#160;in its own amiable Light, to make it truly&#160;Lovely:</p>
            <p> IF to draw Characters&#160;justly, and to support them&#160;equally:</p>
            <p> IF to raise a Distress from&#160;natural&#160;Causes, and to excite Compassion
               from&#160;proper&#160;Motives:</p>
            <p> IF to teach the Man of&#160;Fortune&#160;how to use it; the Man of&#160;Passion&#160;how to subdue it;
               and the Man of&#160;Intrigue, how, gracefully, and with Honour to himself, to&#160;reclaim:</p>
            <p> IF to give&#160;practical&#160;Examples, worthy to be followed in the
               most&#160;critical&#160;and&#160;affecting&#160;Cases, by the&#160;modest&#160;Virgin, the&#160;chaste&#160;Bride, and
               the&#160;obliging&#160;Wife:</p>
            <p> IF to effect all these good Ends,&#160;in so probable, so natural, so&#160;lively&#160;a manner, as
               shall engage the Passions of every sensible Reader, and strongly interest them in the
               edifying Story:</p>
            <p> AND all&#160;without raising a single&#160;Idea&#160;throughout the Whole, that shall shock the
               exactest Purity, even in those tender Instances where the exactest Purity would be
               most apprehensive:</p>
            <p> IF these, (embellished with a great Variety of entertaining Incidents)&#160;be laudable
               or worthy Recommendations of any Work, the Editor of the following Letters, which
               have their Foundation inTruth&#160;and&#160;Nature, ventures to assert,&#160;vithat all these
               desirable Ends are obtained&#160;in these Sheets: And as he is therefore confident of the
               favourable Reception which he boldly bespeaks for this little Work; he thinks
               any&#160;further Preface&#160;or&#160;Apology&#160;for it, unnecessary: And the rather for two Reasons,
               1st. Because he can Appeal from&#160;his own&#160;Passions, (which have been
               uncommonly&#160;moved&#160;in perusing these engaging Scenes) to the Passions of&#160;Every one&#160;who
               shall read them with the least Attention: And, in the next place, because
               an&#160;Editor&#160;may reasonably be supposed to judge with an Impartiality which is rarely to
               be met with in an&#160;Author&#160;towards his own Works.</p>
            <p> The Editor.</p>
