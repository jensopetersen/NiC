                    <p>This page is appearing because type is play--not clear exactly how to alter the controller and in app:work-title to modify the result. There are no plays in this database, and I don't anticipate there being any need to do this test--all the pages should be viewed in a single page type (not view-play.html or view-work.html, just view-work.html). I would also like to put page images here, so that they don't interrupt the flow of text in the main reading page, but I'd like to keep the page-breaks in the xml files as is. </p>
                    <p>Question: what if the project incorporates images not as page facsimiles, but as actual images? That is, now I'm privileging the textual content, and the page images would be in the side bar. But what if I included a primary source that was only visual, with no text? It should be prioritized, clearly. </p>
